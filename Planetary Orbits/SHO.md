# Simple Harmonic Oscillator

One of the most straightforward examples of a continuous dynamical system is the **simple harmonic oscillator**. This is any system in which the displacement of the modelled object from its equilibrium position subjects the object exactly to a restoring force proportional to the displacement. In other words, a simple harmonic oscillator is any system in which
$$ \mathbf{F} = -k\mathbf{x}, \quad k > 0 $$
is the only force acting on the system. This applies to systems such as the motion of:
- mass on spring
- small-angle pendulum
- point on standing wave
- elastic single-mode cantilever
- scotch yoke mechanism
